# Time Series Clustering Along with Optimizations for the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Distance

Time series clustering with a wide variety of strategies and a series of
optimizations specific to the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance and
its corresponding lower bounds (LBs). There are implementations of both
traditional clustering algorithms, and more recent procedures such as
k-Shape and TADPole clustering. Functionality can be easily extended
with custom distance measures and centroid definitions.

Many of the algorithms implemented in this package are specifically
tailored to DTW, hence its name. However, the main clustering function
is flexible so that one can test many different clustering approaches,
using either the time series directly, or by applying suitable
transformations and then clustering in the resulting space. Other
implementations included in the package provide some alternatives to
DTW.

## Installation

The latest version from CRAN can be installed with
`install.packages("dtwclust")`.

If you want to test the latest version from github, first install the
[prerequisites for R package
development](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites)
(LaTeX is only necessary if you want to build the vignette) as well as
the [remotes package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes), and
then type `remotes::install_github("asardaes/dtwclust")`.

If you’re wondering about which version to install, take a look at the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file, I try to keep it updated. Check the
[Unix](https://travis-ci.org/asardaes/dtwclust) and
[Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/asardaes/dtwclust) continuous
integration builds to make sure everything is working, but do note that
they tend to fail for reasons unrelated to the package’s functionality.

acf_fun <- function(series, ...) {
    lapply(series, function(x) { as.numeric(acf(x, lag.max = 50L, plot = FALSE)$acf) })
}
# Autocorrelation-based fuzzy c-means
fc <- tsclust(CharTraj[1L:25L], type = "fuzzy", k = 5L,
              preproc = acf_fun, distance = "L2",
              seed = 123L)

### *Some* multivariate support

``` r
# Multivariate series provided as a list of matrices, using GAK distance
mvc <- tsclust(CharTrajMV[1L:20L], k = 4L, distance = "gak", seed = 390L)
# Note how the variables of each series are appended one after the other in the plot
plot(mvc, labels = list(nudge_x = -10, nudge_y = 1))
