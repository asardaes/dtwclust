Description: Time series clustering along with optimized techniques related
    to the Dynamic Time Warping distance and its corresponding lower bounds.
    Implementations of partitional, hierarchical, fuzzy, k-Shape and TADPole
    clustering are available. Functionality can be easily extended with
    custom distance measures and centroid definitions.
