Description: Time series clustering along with optimized techniques related
    to the Dynamic Time Warping distance and its corresponding lower bounds.
    Implementations of partitional, hierarchical, fuzzy, k-Shape and TADPole
    clustering are available. Functionality can be easily extended with
    custom distance measures and centroid definitions. Implementations of
    DTW barycenter averaging and a distance based on global alignment kernels
    are also provided. All included distance functions have custom loops
    optimized for the calculation of cross-distance matrices, including
    parallelization support. Several cluster validity indices are included.
