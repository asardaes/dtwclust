\description{
This is the main function to perform time series clustering. See the details and the examples for
more information, as well as the included package vignettes (which can be found by typing
\code{browseVignettes("dtwclust")}). A convenience wrapper is available in \code{\link[=compare_clusterings]{compare_clusterings()}},
and a shiny app in \code{\link[=interactive_clustering]{interactive_clustering()}}.
}
\details{
Partitional and fuzzy clustering procedures use a custom implementation. Hierarchical clustering
is done with \code{\link[stats:hclust]{stats::hclust()}} by default. TADPole clustering uses the \code{\link[=TADPole]{TADPole()}} function.
Specifying \code{type} = \code{"partitional"}, \code{preproc} = \code{zscore}, \code{distance} = \code{"sbd"} and \code{centroid} =
\code{"shape"} is equivalent to the k-Shape algorithm (Paparrizos and Gravano 2015).

The \code{series} may be provided as a matrix, a data frame or a list. Matrices and data frames are
coerced to a list, both row-wise. Only lists can have series with different lengths or multiple
dimensions. Most of the optimizations require series to have the same length, so consider
reinterpolating them to save some time (see Ratanamahatana and Keogh 2004; \code{\link[=reinterpolate]{reinterpolate()}}). No
missing values are allowed.

In the case of multivariate time series, they should be provided as a list of matrices, where
time spans the rows of each matrix and the variables span the columns (see \link{CharTrajMV} for an
example). All included centroid functions should work with the aforementioned format, although
\code{shape} is \emph{not} recommended. Note that the \code{plot} method will simply append all dimensions
(columns) one after the other.
}
\note{
The lower bounds are defined only for time series of equal length. They are \strong{not} symmetric,
and \code{DTW} is not symmetric in general.
}
\section{Centroid Calculation}{


In the case of partitional/fuzzy algorithms, a suitable function should calculate the cluster
centroids at every iteration. In this case, the centroids may also be time series. Fuzzy
clustering uses the standard fuzzy c-means centroid by default.

In either case, a custom function can be provided. If one is provided, it will receive the
following parameters with the shown names (examples for partitional clustering are shown in
parentheses):
\itemize{
\item \code{x}: The \emph{whole} data list (\code{list(ts1, ts2, ts3)})
\item \code{cl_id}: An integer vector with length equal to the number of series in \code{data}, indicating
which cluster a series belongs to (\code{c(1L, 2L, 2L)})
\item \code{k}: The desired number of total clusters (\code{2L})
\item \code{cent}: The current centroids in order, in a list (\code{list(centroid1, centroid2)})
\item \code{cl_old}: The membership vector of the \emph{previous} iteration (\code{c(1L, 1L, 2L)})
\item The elements of \code{...} that match its formal arguments
}

In case of fuzzy clustering, the membership vectors (2nd and 5th elements above) are matrices
with number of rows equal to amount of elements in the data, and number of columns equal to the
number of desired clusters. Each row must sum to 1.

The other option is to provide a character string for the custom implementations. The following
options are available:
\itemize{
\item "mean": The average along each dimension. In other words, the average of all \eqn{x^j_i}
among the \eqn{j} series that belong to the same cluster for all time points \eqn{t_i}.
\item "median": The median along each dimension. Similar to mean.
\item "shape": Shape averaging. By default, all series are z-normalized in this case, since the
resulting centroids will also have this normalization. See \code{\link[=shape_extraction]{shape_extraction()}} for more
details.
\item "dba": DTW Barycenter Averaging. See \code{\link[=DBA]{DBA()}} for more details.
\item "sdtw_cent": Soft-DTW centroids, See \code{\link[=sdtw_cent]{sdtw_cent()}} for more details.
\item "pam": Partition around medoids (PAM). This basically means that the cluster centroids are
always one of the time series in the data. In this case, the distance matrix can be
pre-computed once using all time series in the data and then re-used at each iteration. It
usually saves overhead overall for small datasets (see \link{tsclust-controls}).
\item "fcm": Fuzzy c-means. Only supported for fuzzy clustering and used by default in that case.
\item "fcmdd": Fuzzy c-medoids. Only supported for fuzzy clustering. It \strong{always} precomputes/uses
the whole cross-distance matrix.
}

The \code{dba}, \code{shape} and \code{sdtw_cent} implementations check for parallelization. Note that only
\code{shape}, \code{dba}, \code{sdtw_cent}, \code{pam} and \code{fcmdd} support series of different length. Also note
that for \code{shape}, \code{dba} and \code{sdtw_cent}, this support has a caveat: the final centroids' length
will depend on the length of those series that were randomly chosen at the beginning of the
clustering algorithm. For example, if the series in the dataset have a length of either 10 or
15, 2 clusters are desired, and the initial choice selects two series with length of 10, the
final centroids will have this same length.

As special cases, if hierarchical or tadpole clustering is used, you can provide a centroid
function that takes a list of series as first input. It will also receive the contents of
\code{args$cent} that match its formal arguments, and should return a single centroid series. These
centroids are returned in the \code{centroids} slot. By default, the medoid of each cluster is
extracted (similar to what \code{\link[=pam_cent]{pam_cent()}} does).

In the following cases, the \code{centroids} list will have an attribute \code{series_id} with an integer
vector indicating which \code{series} were chosen as centroids:
\itemize{
\item Partitional clustering using "pam" centroid.
\item Fuzzy clustering using "fcmdd" centroid.
\item Hierarchical clustering with the default centroid extraction.
\item TADPole clustering with the default centroid extraction.
}
}

\section{Distance Measures}{


The distance measure to be used with partitional, hierarchical and fuzzy clustering can be
modified with the \code{distance} parameter. The supported option is to provide a string, which must
represent a compatible distance registered with \code{proxy}'s \code{\link[proxy:dist]{proxy::dist()}}. Registration is done
via \code{\link[proxy:registry]{proxy::pr_DB()}}, and extra parameters can be provided in \code{args$dist} (see the examples).

Note that you are free to create your own distance functions and register them. Optionally, you
can use one of the following custom implementations (all registered with \code{proxy}):
\itemize{
\item \code{"dtw"}: DTW, optionally with a Sakoe-Chiba/Slanted-band constraint. Done with \code{\link[dtw:dtw]{dtw::dtw()}}.
\item \code{"dtw2"}: DTW with L2 norm and optionally a Sakoe-Chiba/Slanted-band constraint. See
\code{\link[=dtw2]{dtw2()}}.
\item \code{"dtw_basic"}: A custom version of DTW with less functionality, but faster. See
\code{\link[=dtw_basic]{dtw_basic()}}.
\item \code{"dtw_lb"}: DTW with L1 or L2 norm and a Sakoe-Chiba constraint. Some computations are
avoided by first estimating the distance matrix with Lemire's lower bound and then
iteratively refining with DTW. See \code{\link[=dtw_lb]{dtw_lb()}}. Not suitable for \code{pam.precompute} = \code{TRUE} nor
hierarchical clustering.
\item \code{"lbk"}: Keogh's lower bound for DTW with either L1 or L2 norm for the Sakoe-Chiba
constraint. See \code{\link[=lb_keogh]{lb_keogh()}}.
\item \code{"lbi"}: Lemire's lower bound for DTW with either L1 or L2 norm for the Sakoe-Chiba
constraint. See \code{\link[=lb_improved]{lb_improved()}}.
\item \code{"sbd"}: Shape-based distance. See \code{\link[=sbd]{sbd()}}.
\item \code{"gak"}: Global alignment kernels. See \code{\link[=gak]{gak()}}.
\item \code{"sdtw"}: Soft-DTW. See \code{\link[=sdtw]{sdtw()}}.
}

Out of the aforementioned, only the distances based on DTW lower bounds \emph{don't} support series
of different length. The lower bounds are probably unsuitable for direct clustering unless
series are very easily distinguishable.

If you know that the distance function is symmetric, and you use a hierarchical algorithm, or a
partitional algorithm with PAM centroids, or fuzzy c-medoids, some time can be saved by
calculating only half the distance matrix. Therefore, consider setting the symmetric control
parameter to \code{TRUE} if this is the case (see \link{tsclust-controls}).
}

\section{Preprocessing}{


It is strongly advised to use z-normalization in case of \code{centroid = "shape"}, because the
resulting series have this normalization (see \code{\link[=shape_extraction]{shape_extraction()}}). Therefore, \code{\link[=zscore]{zscore()}} is
the default in this case. The user can, however, specify a custom function that performs any
transformation on the data, but the user must make sure that the format stays consistent, i.e.
a list of time series.

Setting to \code{NULL} means no preprocessing (except for \code{centroid = "shape"}). A provided function
will receive the data as first argument, followed by the contents of \code{args$preproc} that match
its formal arguments.

It is convenient to provide this function if you're planning on using the \code{\link[stats:predict]{stats::predict()}}
generic (see also \link{TSClusters-methods}).
}

\section{Repetitions}{


Due to their stochastic nature, partitional clustering is usually repeated several times with
different random seeds to allow for different starting points. This function uses
\code{\link[parallel:RngStream]{parallel::nextRNGStream()}} to obtain different seed streams for each repetition, utilizing the
\code{seed} parameter (if provided) to initialize it. If more than one repetition is made, the
streams are returned in an attribute called \code{rng}.

Multiple values of \code{k} can also be provided to get different partitions using any \code{type} of
clustering.

Repetitions are greatly optimized when PAM centroids are used and the whole distance matrix is
precomputed, since said matrix is reused for every repetition.
}

\section{Parallel Computing}{


Please note that running tasks in parallel does \strong{not} guarantee faster computations. The
overhead introduced is sometimes too large, and it's better to run tasks sequentially.

The user can register a parallel backend, e.g. with the \pkg{doParallel} package, in order to
attempt to speed up the calculations (see the examples). This relies on \code{\link[foreach:foreach]{foreach::foreach()}},
i.e. it uses multi-processing.

Multi-processing is used in partitional and fuzzy clustering for multiple values of \code{k} and/or
\code{nrep} (in \code{\link[=partitional_control]{partitional_control()}}). See \code{\link[=TADPole]{TADPole()}} to know how it uses parallelization. For
cross-distance matrix calculations, the parallelization strategy depends on whether the
distance is included with \pkg{dtwclust} or not, see the caveats in \linkS4class{tsclustFamily}.

If you register a parallel backend and special packages must be loaded, provide their names in
the \code{packages} element of \code{control}. Note that "dtwclust" is always loaded in each parallel
worker, so that doesn't need to be included. Alternatively, you may want to pre-load
\pkg{dtwclust} in each worker with \code{\link[parallel:clusterApply]{parallel::clusterEvalQ()}}.
